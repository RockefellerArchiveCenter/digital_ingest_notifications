# digital ingest notifications
Handles notifications for services associated with ingest of digital content.

## Getting Started

With [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, pull down the source code and move into the newly created directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/digital_ingest_notifications.git
cd digital_ingest_notifications
```

## Service Flow

The service processes requests as follows:
- Parses the message body and attributes
- Updates package data in the [Zodiac Backend API](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/zodiac_backend/)
- Updates the events associated with the package in the Zodiac Backend API
- If the service completed successfully, send a message to start the next service, which will be handled by [digital_ingest_trigger](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/digital_ingest_trigger/)

## Usage

This repository is intended to be deployed as a Lambda script in AWS infrastructure.

### Expected Message Format

The script is designed to consume message from an AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue. These messages are expected have the following attributes:
- `package_id` - an identifier associated with the package
- `service` - the service which produced the message
- `outcome` - the outcome of the service (`STARTED`, `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`)

If temporary storage is needed for the next task, the message includes a `size` attribute specifying the size of the original (compressed) package.

If the message indicates the successful completion of a service, the body of the message contains package data.

If the message indicates that a service has failed, the body of the message contains a detailed error traceback.

Start messages do not include either package data or an error traceback.

## Contributing

This is an open source project and we welcome contributions! If you want to fix a bug, or have an idea of how to enhance the application, the process looks like this:

1. File an issue in this repository. This will provide a location to discuss proposed implementations of fixes or enhancements, and can then be tied to a subsequent pull request.
2. If you have an idea of how to fix the bug (or make the improvements), fork the repository and work in your own branch. When you are done, push the branch back to this repository and set up a pull request. Automated unit tests are run on all pull requests. Any new code should have unit test coverage, documentation (if necessary), and should conform to the Python PEP8 style guidelines.
3. After some back and forth between you and core committers (or individuals who have privileges to commit to the base branch of this repository), your code will probably be merged, perhaps with some minor changes.

This repository contains a configuration file for git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks which help ensure that code is linted before it is checked into version control. It is strongly recommended that you install these hooks locally by installing pre-commit and running `pre-commit install`.

## Tests

New code should have unit tests. Tests can be run using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/).
